# MyFirstGame
Welcome everyone! This is it, after years wondering how would it be to make a videogame, thinking about all the knowledge I would need to do it, waiting for the right moment.. and so forth finding excuses for not doing it. Here I am, making my first game, don't have a name yet, have an idea though, here I go explaining the prototype:

 - First prototype will be an endless 2D game, in which you have to dodge infinite balls bouncing around the arena moving left righ and jumping while in the same time you try to destroy them.
 - The main character can only dodge.
 - You can destroy the balls using a flying platform right above your head
 - TBOI command style, left stick (or WASD) move the player, right stick (or directions) move the "weapon"
 - Possible power ups randomly spawning
 - Wanna add a mechanic that triggers whenever the player jumps on the platform (shockwave, laser, power up realted..?)

That's pretty much all I have right now. I will update this document as the ideas keep coming.
See ya'll!
